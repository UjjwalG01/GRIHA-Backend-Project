A College Backend Project on node.js, express and MongoDB

This is a room booking system that allows users to book rooms online with the needed facilities. 
The system is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. Users can view the available rooms, 
check their availability, and book them online. 
All the users can view the available rooms but only the registered users are only able to book the rooms by creating the user account and logging into it.
The system also provides information about the facilities available in each room.
